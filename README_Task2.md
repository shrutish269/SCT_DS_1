# 🚢 Task 2: Data Cleaning and EDA on Titanic `gender_submission.csv`

## 📌 Task Objective

Perform **Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the `gender_submission.csv` file from the Titanic dataset on Kaggle. This file contains survival predictions based on gender.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Used

- **File:** `gender_submission.csv`
- **Columns:**
  - `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger
  - `Survived`: Survival prediction (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Checked for **null/missing values** — none found.
- Verified **data types** were appropriate.
- Confirmed dataset is already clean and ready for analysis.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Since the dataset contains only survival predictions, the following visualizations were created:

### ✅ Survival Prediction Count

- Bar chart showing number of passengers predicted to survive vs not survive.

### ✅ Survival Prediction Pie Chart

- Pie chart visualizing the percentage of predicted survivors and non-survivors.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- The dataset contains a **binary prediction** of survival.
- The model predicts a higher survival rate for a particular group (assumed based on gender, as this file is commonly used for gender-based baseline).
- Although no other features (like age, class, sex) are present, the analysis helps understand survival distribution.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib

---

## 📌 Note

For deeper insights and correlation analysis, datasets like `train.csv` (which include age, sex, class, etc.) are recommended. `gender_submission.csv` is best used for evaluating gender-based prediction models.
